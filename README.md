# Depth-of-Anaesthesia-design
The design of a novel depth of anaesthesia (DoA) using different supervised machine learning models.

In any successful surgery, accurate monitoring of the depth of anaesthesia (DoA) is very important.

This study aims to build DoA index using different supervised machine learning algorithms.
